h2. BeTrains ?

BeTrains is an open sourced Android application based on the iRail api (http://api.irail.be).

This application is an alternative to the official SNCB/NMBS and Railtime (official trains company in Belgium), aiming to be really lighter, following the Android guidelines, and more intuitive and user friendly.
