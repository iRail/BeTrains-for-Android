h2. BeTrains ?
BeTrains is an open sourced Android application based on the iRail api (http://project.irail.be/wiki/API/APIv1).

This application is an alternative to the official SNCB/NMBS and Railtime (official trains company in Belgium), aiming to be really lighter, following the Android guidelines, and more intuitive and user friendly.
